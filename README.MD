    <b>Kokumaji</b> | Full-stack Developer in Java, NodeJS, React and Python 🌿
</h3>

**Hey there!** I'm a full-stack developer originating from Essen, Germany. 🍃 
I've been interested in technology all my life and started coding when I was just 13 years old. What started with simple **HTML + CSS** projects later evolved to larger scale **NodeJS**-based bots. I eventually came across Minecraft server plugin development in **Java/Kotlin** which really sparked my passion for software development. 

Fast-forward 10 years, I am now working on getting a degree in software development. Throughout the years I acquired a couple more skills by following coding trends and exploring what big companies use. Thats why you will always see me use **MongoDB** for managing data in projects and **Docker** for running said projects.

What I really enjoy about coding is, that there are so many ways to solve a problem, its just a matter of finding the right solution and making sure its performant.

As of right now, there isn't really something I can or want to share, my repositories are quite old and mostly unmaintained. I am hoping to add a couple more demo projects to demonstrate my skills.
